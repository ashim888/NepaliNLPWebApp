The web app used for Nepali Language Natural Language Processing - Work in Progres

We have targeted to crawl over 1 million webpages in Nepali Language (as of 4/6/2017 - We have crawled little over 150000 pages)

Natural Language Processing Involves 6 stages, generally speaking.
<br>
<b>Corpus Formation</b>
This step is where you would build a large dictionary like structure of most words used in a language. The data can be gathered
from a variety of sources including web, books, pdfs,texts. The data would then be pre-procesed, words/sentences extracted,
parts of speech tagged, lemmas defined. We are currently at this stage.

<b>Lexical Analysis:</b> 
It involves identifying and analyzing the structure of words. The Lexicon of a language means the 
collection of words and phrases in a language. The lexical analysis is dividing the whole chunk of text into paragraphs, 
sentences and words.

<b>Syntactic Analysis/Parsing:</b> 
It involves the analysis of words in the sentence for grammar and arranging those words in such a manner that 
it shows the relationship between the words. The sentence such as “The school goes to boy” is rejected 
by English syntactic analyzer.

<b>Semantic Analysis:</b> 
This analysis draws either the exact meaning or the dictionary meaning from the text. 
The text is checked for a quality of significance. It is done by mapping the syntactic structures along with the 
objects in the task domain. The semantic analyzer disregards the sentence such as “hot ice-cream”.

<b>Discourse Integration:</b> 
The meaning of any sentence depends on upon the meaning of the sentence just before it. In addition, it also brings 
about the meaning of immediately succeeding sentence.

<b>Pragmatic Analysis:</b> 
During this analysis what was said is re-interpreted on what it actually meant. It involves driving those aspects 
of language which require the real world knowledge.
